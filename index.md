My name is Dimos and I’m a doctoral student in the [Gollisch lab](https://www.retina.uni-goettingen.de/) at the University Medical Center Göttingen under the supervision of Tim Gollisch.

My research focuses on the retinal encoding of natural scenes. I work at the interface of computational neuroscience and large-scale electrophysiology.

I have previously studied Neuroscience at the [IMPRS Göttingen](https://www.gpneuro.uni-goettingen.de/) and Medicine at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/). You can find my CV [here](./karamanlis_cv.pdf).
